= Making Changes
These four commands are some of the most requently used Linux commands. Used for manipulating both files and directories.


You'll use the following comands:
* `*cp*` - copy files and directories
* `*mv*` = move or rename files and directories
* `*rm*` - removie files and directories
* `*mkdir*` = create directories

In some instanes it's easier to use a graphical file manager to manipulate a bunch of files at once. 

But there's more power and flexibiltiy in using the shell For example, imagine needing to copy all all the HTML files from one directory into another but 

cp - u  )
google.com
--0000
