== Commands and Concepts 

Commands: pwd, ls

Concepts: current working directory, absolute vs relative paths, listing files and directories, using flags and options


== Exercise 1: Detemermine your location

. *pwd* prints your current working directory. Enter `*pwd*` in the command-line and hit the return key to view the path of your home directory:
+
[source,bash]
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *pwd*
----
+
. As an example, my input (command) and output (path) looks like this:
+
[source,sh]
[subs=+quotes]
----
Dylans-Macbook-Pro:~ eljefe$ *pwd*
/Users/eljefe
----
+
. Where `/Users/eljefe` is the path of my home directory.  
+
[NOTE] 
====
The path of your home directory depends on your username and your operating system. But generally, it should like this: 

* macOS: `/Users/_username_`
* Linux-based OS: `/home/_username_`
* Windows: `C:\Users{backslash}__username__`
====

== Exercise 2: Listing files and directories 

. *ls* lists the contents of your current working directory directory. In your home directory, run `*ls*` and `*ls -F*:
+
NOTE: the minus sign (-) is called a flag. Flags are used to add options. Options alter the output of a command.  
+
[source,sh]
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *ls*
mydir
$ *ls -F*
mydir/
----
+
The output is different the second time. The files that contain a slash (*/*) at the end of their name are directories.
+
. List the contents of another directory by specifying the path. Run `*ls -F mydir*`:
+
[source,sh]
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *ls -F mydir*
my-dir01/        my-dir02/
----
+
. There are two directories contained within `mydir/`:
..  `my-dir01/` and 
.. `mydir02/`. 
+
. Let's inspect both of them:
+
[TIP]
.Features of the Shell
====
.. History: Press the up-arrow on your keyboard to recall previously entered commands. 
.. Auto-complete: Press the tab key on your keyboard when entering text in the command line. If the shell recognizes the name of a command, directory, or file, it'll fill out the rest!
====
+
[source,sh]
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *ls mydir/my-dir01*
$ *ls mydir/my-dir02*
my_dir01/        my_dir02/
---- 
+ 
. Try running: 
+ 
[source,sh]
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *cd my-dir02*
bash: cd: my-dir02: No such file or directory
---- 
+
. `No such file or directory` is a common error. When you receive this error, ask yourself: 
.. did I spell the file/directory name correctly?
.. did I utilize the correct path?
+
{zwsp} +

So far all of the commands we have run are examples examples of *relative paths* (pathnames that link us to our destination only from our current working directory). 

== Exercise 3: Listing content in the root directory

. *Absolute paths* link us to our destination regardless of our current working directory. An example of this is the the path of the root directory. Run `*ls /*`:
+
[source,sh]
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *ls -F /*
----
+
[source,sh]
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *ls -F*
----
. Look for a directory called `bin/` and list its content:
+
[source,sh]
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *ls /bin*
----
+
. Do you see the file `ls*`? This is one of several locations where shell programs (commands) are stored. The asterick * means the files are *executable* (able to run in the command line). 

== Test yourself

*Problems*:

. For listing the content of `mydir-02`
.. what directory would we need to be in to run `*cd my-dir02*`?
.. What is the absolute path of `my-dir02`?
.. Why did the command `*cd mydir/mydir-02*` run even though we didn't specify an absolute path?
. In your home and root directories, Run `*ls*` with the following options and determine the effect that they have on the output:
.. `*ls -1*`
.. `*ls -a*`

*Answers*:

. For listing the content of `mydir-02`
.. Directory: `mydir/` 
.. Absolute path: `/Users/_username_/mydir/mydir-02` where the first slash `/` is the root directory.
.. The current working directory had the path name `/Users/_username_/mydir` which is linked to `mydir-02` (refer to ANSWER b.)
. In your home and root directories, Run `*ls*` with the following options and determine the effect that they have on the output:
.. list all the files, one per line
.. `ls -a` List all files, including hidden files: those that begin with dot (.)

CAUTION: hidden files shouldn't be messed with until you are more familiar with the command-line! 

== Common Errors

`No such file or directory`: Check that your path is correct. If you can't tell, using absolute paths may be helpful.
