== Introduction: What is the shell? And what is the terminal?

Running a shell process with the terminal
*GOAL: Learn how to use the terminal to run commands in the shell.*

We run shell commands to tell the computer what to do. But to write out the commands, we need to use a command-line interface called the terminal. 

* *Exercises, resources and troubleshooting*: terminal, shell, and command-line basics

== Filesystem


*GOAL: Learn how to navigate the filesystem using the shell.* 

Everything stored on a computer's hard drive is a file (even DIRECTORIES [a.k.a. folders]). In Unix-like OSs, *filesystems* have a hierarchical structure analogous to an upside down tree. All files and directories within the filesystem,have have a direct path that leads back to the *root* *directory* (written as a slash /). Subtle differences exist depending on the OS, but they all have the same general structure.

== Navigate (listing things, moving around and wildcards)

The very first thing that you're going to want to do after opening the terminal is figure out where you are and what you're looking at. 
Click hxref:listing-things.adoc[here] to learn how to navigate within the terminal. 


Commands: pwd, ls, cd

Concepts: command prompt, current working directory, absolute vs relative paths, listing files and directories, using flags and options, the directories . and ..

.Quick Reference: list things and move around like a boss
|===
| Command | Meaning 

|`pwd`
|Print current working directory

|`ls`
| List all the files

| `ls -l`
| List all the files, permissions and last edit time

| `ls -1`
| List all the files, one per line

| `ls -a`
| Include hidden files

| `ls -F`
| List file types

|`cd _/my/desired/location_`
| changes directories to desired location

| `cd`
| go to your home directory

|`cd ~`
| go to your home directory

| `cd ..`
| go up one directory

| `cd ../..`
| go up two directories
|===

NOTE: Typing `cd` with no argument always returns you to your home directory on Unix-like systems. This is super helpful if you're lost in the filesystem. +
In Windows, you'll want to use `cd ~` instead.




== Making files and directories
////
IMPORTANT: Don't use special characters or spaces... EVER. This results in a risk of your filename interfering with commands or being read improperly by programs. If you do somehow end up with a filename with special characters or spaces, put it in quotes or single quotes when referencing it. (Example: 'file name.txt'.) This is not a foolproof solution, but may help.

NOTE: acceptable characters: dash - underscore _ or forward slash /
