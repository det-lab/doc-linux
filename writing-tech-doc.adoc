# First Day

(onboarding)

on our first day focus on getting your bearings

- what to expect, whats expected of them, guidance, hold them by the hand

- school work

# Start the Project

things very naturally become a habit, the day to day things,
things that come up naturally

- knowing where the code is
- where are the dependencies
- document everything that is a part of the daily work

- go by steps

for ex: " start by cloning the project by cloning the following command"

always use a screen shot or code snippet for visual representation so readers are rest assured

- once done, run the next command

- once the command is finished, you should see something like this

- CREATE DOCUMENTATION SPARINGLY, BARE BONE MINIMUM
